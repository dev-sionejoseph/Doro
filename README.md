### Problem Statement:

Often, people can get caught up in their to-do-list; pushing too far past their limits in the name of completeting tasks. I, myself have experience how easy it is to lose track of how long you've been working, and "taking breaks" becomes a foreign concept. For that reason, using the Pomodoro method can be really helpful. So, in the interest of centralizing all things needed to get started with this method of task completion, I decided to build an app that can store your to-do lists as well as run a timer at 25min intervals to remind you when to break.
